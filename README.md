# ResNet50-Transfer-Learning-with-Keras

# Introduction

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a ResNet-50 model using transfer learning with Keras. The goal is to solve TensorFlowâ€™s demo image classification problem by building a classifier to classify a dataset containing five different classes of flowers.

# Prerequisites

Basic understanding of deep learning concepts.

Familiarity with Python programming language.

Installation of TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
